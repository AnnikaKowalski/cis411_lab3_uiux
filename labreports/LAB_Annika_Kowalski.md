# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |  
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | Score 1 | Indeed was a very well set up website to look for jobs. I was able to search job posting by date posted, if the job was in person or remote, how far from my house or town of residency. I was also able to choose if I wanted a full time, part time or internship, location and company. Each of the refinements made it easier for me to search jobs.  |  
| Ziprecruiter | Score 2 | Ziprecruiter jas a very nice website that allows users to search specific jobs or search a location for all jobs available. |

## 2.2 Site 1 Indeed.com
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3  |  The website was very easy to use. I was able to search based on jobs I was looking for as well as by location.  ![SearchArea](/assets/SearchArea.png) I searched for jobs in Lancaster PA|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | I was able to search for jobs as soon as I was on the website. No log in was required to search for jobs. This process was very easy.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 |  Indeed allows user sot customize the search results for what they are looking for which is very helpful. They allow users to search based on the categories listed at the top of the screen. ![SearchArea](/assets/SearchArea.png) This image shows how users can search for jobs. I searched for internships in Lancaster PA.![Job](/assets/Job.png) When you search jobs this is how they are displayed. I then clicked on a job that interested me and was given more information if I wanted to apply. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3 | When you return to the website you can log in to your profile which allows the user to access their profile, check messages and other features. ![LogIn](/assets/LogIn.png) This is the login page for Indeed. ![Profile](/assets/Profile.png) This image shows a users profile page.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  |  Indeed.com uses the correct of amount of words to explain their features and different pages on their website. I think at times Indeed could use more words but it is not necessary.  ![Footer](/assets/Footer.png) This image is the footer of Indeed's website. I feel that is sufficient but more words could be added for clarity. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | I feel that Indeed has good navigation features on their website. They have a combination of words and images to show users different pages and features on their website.  ![Header](/assets/Header.png) This image is the header of Indeed.com and I feel that it has appropriate word usage to convey the different pages on their website. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | When you search Indeed.com you are given a webpage with the an aea to search for jobs and also by location. I think the ads on the page can be distracting and/or irrelevant to job searching. ![Homepage](/assets/Homepage.png) |
| **TOTAL** |  19 | Overall Indeed.com is a very good website to search for jobs. The application process seems very easy, it allows users to go navigate to the website of the job they are applying for which I find to be very helpful. I would definitely use this app to look for internships, full time and part time work since it was very esa to navigate and use. |

## 2.3 Site 2 Ziprecruiter
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  1 |  Ziprecruiter has a website that I find hard to navigate. There are no spots where I can refine searches which is frustrating. ![Homepage_ZR](/assets/Homepage_ZR.png) This image is the homepage for Ziprecruiter. ![Homepage2_ZR](/assets/Homepage2_ZR.png) This image is also the homepage for Ziprecruiter. Each time I searched ziprecuiter.com I received different homepages. This is frustrating as a user.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time? | 2  |  When I went to search for an IT help desk job in Lancaster, PA it wanted me to input my email before locating any jobs. I was able to move forward without creating an account or inputting my email but it is annoying that each time you enter the site you have to click off that to search jobs. ![Searching_ZR](/assets/Searching_ZR.png) |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  |  At the top of the page after you search it allows users to refine the search which is a nice feature. Overall I think that it is a nice a site to search for jobs. ![JobSearch_ZR](/assets/JobSearch_ZR.png)  ![Features_ZR](/assets/Features_ZR.png) |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2 |  The log-in process is very difficult to navigate. Users have to find the sign in tab and once they find it they have to find the "create an account button." I do not feel that it is straight forward at all which is frustrating. To create an account you have to answer a series of questions which are shown in the image below. ![LogIn_ZR](/assets/LogIn_ZR.png) This image shows the page where users will create an account. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  The bottom of the website page has several useful pages that users are able to click on to gather more information about the site as well as other features. I think that Ziprecruiter uses the correct about of words to convey the messages they want to. ![Footer_ZR](/assets/Footer_ZR.png) This image shows the footer at the bottom of the Ziprecuiter website. ![Header_ZR](/assets/Header_ZR.png) This image shows the header at the top of page and the different pages the site offers. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2 |  The navigation of Ziprecuiter is interesting. The home page and job searching page are great - they allow users to navigate easily with the features at the top of the page. When a user wants to apply for a job it automatically takes them to LinkedIn. Some Ziprecruiter users might not have a LinkedIn account which can make this step challenging for users. ![Applying_ZR](/assets/Applying_ZR.png) THis image shows the LiniedIn page you are taken to when you want to apply for a job. ![Applying2_ZR](/assets/Applying2_ZR.png) This image shows the process a user will go through on LinkedIn to apply for the job they chose.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | I feel that overall the site is hard to access. There were many steps that I needed to skip over just to look for jobs. I was asked several times about signing up for an account and inputting my email just so I could look at jobs which I found to be very annoying. I think that the use and ease of this website cou dbe improved. |
| **TOTAL** |  15 |  Overall the website was not the best. As previously mentioned there were some challenges to using this website. There are definitely improvements that should be made.  |
