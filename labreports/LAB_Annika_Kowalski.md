# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |  
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | Score 1 | Indeed was a very well set up website to look for jobs. I was able to search job posting by date posted, if the job was in person or remote, how far from my house or town of residency. I was also able to choose if I wanted a full time, part time or internship, location and company. Each of the refinements made it easier for me to search jobs.  |  
| Ziprecruiter | Score 2 | Ziprecruiter jas a very nice website that allows users to search specific jobs or search a location for all jobs available. |
